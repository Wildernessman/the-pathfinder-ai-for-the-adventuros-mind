## Need Help?

If you're having trouble:
1. Check if Node.js and npm are installed: `node -v` and `npm -v`
2. Make sure you're in the correct directory when running commands
3. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
4. Check the console for any error messages

## Common Issues

- **'npm' is not recognized**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- **Port already in use**: Try using a different port with `npm run dev -- --port 3000`
- **Module not found errors**: Run `npm install` again
